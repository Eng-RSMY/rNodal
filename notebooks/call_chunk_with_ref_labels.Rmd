## Introduction
Here is my very interesting document.
 
Chunk 1 is calling chunk 2 here, but you can't see it if echo=FALSE

```{r chunk1, ref.label="chunk2", echo=TRUE}
# echo=TRUE
```

```{r chunk11, ref.label="chunk2", echo=FALSE}
# echo=FALSE
```
 
## This chunk is unnamed but can now use code from chunk 2
```{r}
myFunction(7)
```
 
## This is chunk 2
My long and ugly R function is now down here.
 
```{r chunk2}
# it's not really long and ugly
# it just squares the input
# but imagine that it is long and ugly
 
myFunction <- function(x) {
  print(x ^ 2)
}
```
