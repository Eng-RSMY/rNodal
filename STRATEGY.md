## z-factor
* functions that have dots could return a list.
* maybe better to named the functions that return a list like this: `theFunctionL`, where `L` represents the list.

## functions with dots
* these functions are hidden and are special

## The major blocks of rNodal
* PVT
    * the oil properties
    * gas properties
    * water properties

* the tubing at-depth iterator (marching algorithm)
* the VLP correlations
* the IPR correlations

* plotting modules (ggplot2)
* statistical modules
    * interpolation

* compressibility factor, sweet hydrocarbon gases (zFactor)

* utilities
    * the hierarchical structure storage (hdf5)
    * list.names
    * matrix conversion
